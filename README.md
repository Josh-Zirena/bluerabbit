# bluerabbit project

Include A README with instructions on how to build/run the app. Use the README to let us know why you chose the technologies you did. Notes on design patterns, challenges, or aspects of your stack that you find interesting are also appreciated!

There's multiple different technologies I could've used to create this project. I picked node.js and the express framework for the backend, because I've used them before and javascript is the language in which I code the fastest. 

On the frontend, I picked React for the framework because I think it's a great tool to build out a frontend and the hooks are amazing. I used material UI to build out the look and feel, because even the default styling is great. 

Finally, one of the most interesting aspects is that ordinarily I would've used some sort of SQL or NoSQL technology to upload the text/pictures, but for simplicity's sake I used my own harddrive. This led me to find the multer package that I used which worked surprisingly well!

Overall, this small project was a good experience.
